# [iFixit React Commerce](https://react-commerce.vercel.app)

New iFixit e-commerce site.

## Development

The project contains a `backend` folder with Strapi config and a `frontend` with Next.js.
You can run the backend both using SQLite and using Postgres with docker compose. For now the recommended approach for local dev is to just use SQLite.

> :warning: If you are running Strapi using docker compose, be sure to delete `backend/node_modules` first, as your OS might differ from the docker container OS, so you want the docker container to install dependencies by itself.

### Install

This command will install both backend and frontend dependencies:

```sh
npm run npm
```

### Dev server

This command will start Strapi dev server and Next.js dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Using SVG

If you want to use an svg as a React component, add it to `frontend/assets/svg/files` and run

```sh
npm run transform-svg
```

The script will take svg files and transform them into React components that you can import like this:

```tsx
import { LifetimeWarrantyIcon } from "@assets/svg";
```

> :warning: SVGR uses the name of the file to name the component (it converts it to camel case), so name the svg accordingly.
