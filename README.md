# [iFixit React Commerce](https://react-commerce.vercel.app)

New iFixit e-commerce site.

## Development

The project contains a `backend` folder with Strapi config and a `frontend` with Next.js.
You can run the backend both using SQLite and using Postgres with docker compose. For now the recommended approach for local dev is to just use SQLite.

> :warning: If you are running Strapi using docker compose, be sure to delete `backend/node_modules` first, as your OS might differ from the docker container OS, so you want the docker container to install dependencies by itself.

The `frontend` directory is structured as follows:

-  `pages`: contains the Next.js app pages (think of these like routes/controllers)
-  `models`: contains business logic (e.g. how to fetch product list from API, how to subscribe to newsletter, etc.)
-  `components`: contains the React view components
-  `helpers`: contains reusable custom app-related helper functions
-  `lib`: contains custom libraries that can stand on their own (e.g. `lib/algolia`). Think of these as packages that potentially could be used in other projects.
-  `assets`: contains assets imported from view components (e.g. svg illustrations)
-  `public`: contains the static files
-  `config`: contains app configurable settings (e.g. environment variables, constants, etc.)

### Install Prerequisites

-  npm v8
-  pnpm v6
-  node v16
-  yarn

Here's one way you can get all the right versions installed and setup:

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
2. `nvm use`
   -  run this command in the project root to install compatible versions of `node` and `npm`
3. `npm install -g pnpm@6.32.1`
   -  installs version 6 of `pnpm`
   -  :warning: The project is based on `pnpm@6`: some dependencies still have problems with v7

### Install

This command will install both backend and frontend dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install:all
```

>

### Copy the environment files to local

1. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
2. Copy `frontend/.env.local.example` to `frontend/.env.local`

### Fill in the Algolia API Key

In `frontend/.env.local` fill in `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` by either:

-  Copying the `Search API Key` [from Aloglia](https://www.algolia.com/account/api-keys/all?applicationId=XQEP3AD9ZT)

   -  :warning: You may need to ask for access to our Aloglia

-  Or copy the dev key from cominor:

```sh
cat /etc/dozuki/algolia-keys.json | jq --raw-output .searchApiKey
```

(Note: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is not needed in development)

### Dev server

This command will start Strapi dev server and Next.js dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Working with the Frontend (Next.js)

After running the dev server, you can access the site at `http://localhost:3000/Parts` or `http://localhost:3000/Tools`

:warning: `http://localhost:3000/` is not yet routed and will 404.

### Working with the Backend (Strapi)

After running the dev server, you can access the Strapi admin panel at `http://localhost:1337/admin`. To login use email `strapi@ifixit.com` and password `Password1`.

The local Strapi dev server will allow you to make changes to the schema of content types. When you're satisfied with the changes, you can push into a new branch to get a preview url from [govinor](https://govinor.com/).

### Test

This command will start Cypress:

```sh
pnpm run cypress:open
```

### Using SVG

If you want to use an svg as a React component, add it to `frontend/assets/svg/files` and run

```sh
pnpm run transform-svg
```

The script will take svg files and transform them into React components that you can import like this:

```tsx
import { LifetimeWarrantyIcon } from '@assets/svg';
```

> :warning: SVGR uses the name of the file to name the component (it converts it to camel case), so name the svg accordingly.

### Troubleshooting

Since [OSX 12.3](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes), python(2) is no longer available by default.
If no prebuilt image is available for some dependencies like sqlite3, it may be necessary to install python(2) to build the image locally.
Brew has discontinued the python@2 formula, so one way to install it is via `pyenv`:

```
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 2.7.18
pyenv global 2.7.18
echo 'PATH=$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
```
